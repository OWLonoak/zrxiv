  "abstract": "In the strong coupling limit the partition function of SU(2) gauge theory can\nbe reduced to that of the continuous spin Ising model with nearest neighbour\npair-interactions. The random cluster representation of the continuous spin\nIsing model in two dimensions is derived through a Fortuin-Kasteleyn\ntransformation, and the properties of the corresponding cluster distribution\nare analyzed. It is shown that for this model, the magnetic transition is\nequivalent to the percolation transition of Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters, using\nlocal bond weights. These results are also illustrated by means of numerical\nsimulations.",
