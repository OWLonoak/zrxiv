  "abstract": "Consider a statistical physical model on the $d$-regular infinite tree\n$T_{d}$ described by a set of interactions $Φ$. Let $\\{G_{n}\\}$ be a\nsequence of finite graphs with vertex sets $V_n$ that locally converge to\n$T_{d}$. From $Φ$ one can construct a sequence of corresponding models on\nthe graphs $G_n$. Let $\\{μ_n\\}$ be the resulting Gibbs measures. Here we\nassume that $\\{μ_{n}\\}$ converges to some limiting Gibbs measure $μ$ on\n$T_{d}$ in the local weak$^*$ sense, and study the consequences of this\nconvergence for the specific entropies $|V_n|^{-1}H(μ_n)$. We show that the\nlimit supremum of $|V_n|^{-1}H(μ_n)$ is bounded above by the\n\\emph{percolative entropy} $H_{perc}(μ)$, a function of $μ$ itself, and\nthat $|V_n|^{-1}H(μ_n)$ actually converges to $H_{perc}(μ)$ in case $Φ$\nexhibits strong spatial mixing on $T_d$. We discuss a few examples of\nwell-known models for which the latter result holds in the high temperature\nregime.",
