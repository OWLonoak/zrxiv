  "abstract": "  We consider generalizations of the Vieta formula (relating the coefficients\nof an algebraic equation to the roots) to the case of equations whose\ncoefficients are order-$k$ matrices.\n  Specifically, we prove that if $X_1,\\dots ,X_n$ are solutions of an algebraic\nmatrix equation $X^n+A_1X^{n-1}+\\dots +A_n=0,$ independent in the sense that\nthey determine the coefficients $A_1,\\dots ,A_n$, then the trace of $A_1$ is\nthe sum of the traces of the $X_i$, and the determinant of $A_n$ is, up to a\nsign, the product of the determinants of the $X_i$. We generalize this to\narbitrary rings with appropriate structures.\n  This result is related to and motivated by some constructions in\nnon-commutative geometry.\n",
