  "abstract": "The availability of affordable and portable depth sensors has made scanning\nobjects and people simpler than ever. However, dealing with occlusions and\nmissing parts is still a significant challenge. The problem of reconstructing a\n(possibly non-rigidly moving) 3D object from a single or multiple partial scans\nhas received increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we propose a\nnovel learning-based method for the completion of partial shapes. Unlike the\nmajority of existing approaches, our method focuses on objects that can undergo\nnon-rigid deformations. The core of our method is a variational autoencoder\nwith graph convolutional operations that learns a latent space for complete\nrealistic shapes. At inference, we optimize to find the representation in this\nlatent space that best fits the generated shape to the known partial input. The\ncompleted shape exhibits a realistic appearance on the unknown part. We show\npromising results towards the completion of synthetic and real scans of human\nbody and face meshes exhibiting different styles of articulation and\npartiality.",
