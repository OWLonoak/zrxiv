  "abstract": "  To understand the empirical success of approximate MAP inference, recent work\n(Lang et al., 2018) has shown that some popular approximation algorithms\nperform very well when the input instance is stable. The simplest stability\ncondition assumes that the MAP solution does not change at all when some of the\npairwise potentials are (adversarially) perturbed. Unfortunately, this strong\ncondition does not seem to be satisfied in practice. In this paper, we\nintroduce a significantly more relaxed condition that only requires blocks\n(portions) of an input instance to be stable. Under this block stability\ncondition, we prove that the pairwise LP relaxation is persistent on the stable\nblocks. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation of\nreal-world MAP inference instances from computer vision. We design an algorithm\nto find stable blocks, and find that these real instances have large stable\nregions. Our work gives a theoretical explanation for the widespread empirical\nphenomenon of persistency for this LP relaxation.\n",
